  Website:
    'Websites are the way that people acquire information, and all my work is on web sites. I love the psychology of squeeze pages, and the design of a great infinite-scroll.

I think this enhances usability, decreases server and bandwidth costs, and offloads data manipulation and management onto companies that specialize in their data domain.',

    "Optical communications are fascinating to me.

    "I'm fascinated by financial markets and how to analyze them. I got into it when Bitcoin became big, and from there it opened the door to all sorts of financial markets. Now I'm on ScottTrade and Yahoo News all the time. I even moved to Hong Kong for a while to hang out with some banker friends who were writing sentiment analysis software to analyze and execute trades.

  "Investment Banking & Asset Management":
    "As a digital nomad, I've had lots of positive and negative experiences with banks, and lived in lots of places where banking is either not accessible or not affordable to people.

I would love to work on banking tools that make these services more accessible and affordable to everyone.",
  "Motion Picture Production & Distribution":
    "I love movies and TV. To me it's the most powerful way to tell a story because it's immersive, lifelike, and bite-sized.

I would love to help storytellers share their stories with the world by developing new distribution technology.",

  "Consumer Engagement":
    "Customers are savvy, and at the end of the day, the customer is what makes the company. To me, consumer engagement is the best way to understand why the customer is actually using your product and how you can make it better. Like how Vicks finally figured out that people were using NyQuil as a sleep aid and they released ZZZQuil and doubled their market. That kind of stuff is fascinating and awesome to me and it all comes from consumer engagement.",
  "Communications Software":
    "As a super social person. I couldn't live without communications software. Facebook for chatting and events, Slack for coordination, Twitter for outreach. I understand the need for niche communications tools and their communities. I would love to work on a communications platform that helps people connect, discover, and share.",
  "News Outlet":
    'More than ever, reliable news is important. I think we live in an era where facts and opinions are too easily mistaken for one another and we need to make sure that a news source is known to be reliably real and diligent. One step towards this is to remove those stupid "Elsewhere on the web" advertisements that look like news but are actually clickbait. Another ways is to use AI and automation to determine the source and reliability of stories. I would love to work on these types of technologies.',
  "Human Computer Interaction":
    "I believe technology is what defines humanity. It is our destiny to create technology that takes the burden of labour from us.

I would love to help other people enjoy those benefits for themselves by helping to build publishing tools that are accessible to everyone.",
  Aerospace:
    "I've always been fascinated by space, since I as a little kid. \"A Brief History of Time\" was the first book I read and I dreamed of being an astronaut as a kid. Now I'm a pudgy adult and going into space is expesive and dangerous, but sending robots to go into space is fun, cheap, and (relatively) easy. I would love to live my dream vicariously through the eyes of robots by building aerospace technology.",
  "Fin Tech":
    "I'm fascinated by FinTech. I got into it when Bitcoin became big, and from there it opened the door to all sorts of financial markets. Now I'm on ScottTrade and Yahoo News all the time. I wrote all the initial documentation for the Ripple API and built the first Ripple Android app, and I even helped build a Bitcoin ATM a couple years ago in London with the help of ZipZap. I've got a signal processing and machine learning background from doing EEG/brain scanning, and I'd love to marry my passion and experience by building FinTech more tools.",
  "Natural Language Processing":
    "Natural Language Processing is a passion of mine.

I've used Natural Language Processing extensively in my last two roles doing marketing automation, and you may be surprised to know that I used Natural Language Processing when applying for this job at {company}",
  "Speech Recognition":
    "Speech Recognition is profoundly fascinating to me. I believe it has the potential create a world where people talk to their computers the way they talk to people or to their pets.  I did signal processing for my brain scanning startup a few years ago, and for fun I applied those techniques to do beat recognition in live music. The process involved Fourier analysis, time analysis, and fractal analysis - a lot of the same techniques as speech recognition. I'd love to apply my experience and passions to work on speech recognition technology.",

I would love to help create words of experience for anyone who wants to play.",
  Security:
    "Security is critically important in computing. I personally know the pain of having my identity stolen. Complications from that left me stateless for a year and it still haunts me today. Companies have it even worse - they can be faced with losing customers, expensive lawsuits, or even ruin as a result of security breaches. My last startup tried to address Internet security by creating a hardware VPN. Security is a passion of mine and I'd love to get back into it.",
  "Brand Marketing":
    'Brand marketing is my wheelhouse. My first startup did branding and marketing internationally. I think of a company as sort of like a persona. When it comes to brand, I like to ask myself questions like, "What type of texture expresses this company\'s personality? What colors? What way of interacting with customers?" To me, the brand IS the company. Everything the company does from communication to feature selection to products is informed by the brand. I would love to get back into brand marketing with my newfound skills in automation and big data analytics.',
  "Federal Agencies":
    "I'm both a Canadian and an American. As a Canadian, I have a profound respect for the value of government.

  "Business Productivity":
    "As a former startup founder, I know the pain of having inefficient business processes. I implemented a lot of little things here and there such as scrum tracking and such for my own startup, and it would be cool to build business productivity tools for other people as well (also to learn how to be super productive in my own ventures in the future).",
  "Fraud Detection":
    "Fraud detection is critically important to people and to companies. I personally know the pain of having my credit cards and identity stolen.

I would love to make the world a better place by applying my knowledge of machine learning and big data analysis to fraud detection.",
  "Affordable Housing":
    "I'm a Canadian who lives in San Francisco. As someone who lives in San Francisco, I feel the pain that comes from a lack of affordable housing.

  "Zoos & Amusement Parks":
    "When I was a kid, zoos were my favorite place to go. I loved watching the animals watch me watching them. Now I love watching BBC Planet Earth and thinking about how deeply wrong we are in thinking we are independent of nature or animals. We are not only animals, but we are part of the same magnificent legacy of evolution that created these creatures that are truly so similar to us. I would love to work at a zoo, to help create those experiences for others, and to be closer to nature myself.",

  "Staffing & Outsourcing":
    "As a consultant who's struggled to complete complex projects that require the expertise of dozens of people, I've relied heavily on staffing and outsourcing in the past.

I'd love to take that pain away from people making staffing and outsourcing tools more accessible to everyone.",
